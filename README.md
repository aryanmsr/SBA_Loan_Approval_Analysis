# SBA_Loan_Approval_Analysis

This project was part of our "Big Data & Databases" course, where we ended up receiving full points for our analysis. Using a dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), containing historical data of small business loans approved from 1987 to 2014 with 27 variables and 899,164 observations, our aim was to conduct an algorithmic analysis to answer the following research question: "Based on the various risk factors entailed, should an SBA loan be approved or not?"

The steps involved in the project include the following:

1. UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATASET
2. DATA PREPARATION, CLEANING AND EXPLORATION:
• Identification of variables that may be good predictors or risk indicators of the level of risk associated with a loan
• Data exploration : statistics and visualization
• Missing data management
• Outlier treatment
• Creation of new relevant variables
• Variable transformation
3. MODEL BUILDING AND EVALUATION
• Logistic Regression Implementation & Evaluation
• Artifical Neural Network Implementation & Evaluation
• Gradient Boosted Trees Implementation & Evaluation
4. MODEL COMPARISON:
• Comparison of the three models' performance based on relevant metrics to choose the best model
5. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS AND FURTHER INSIGHTS


Virtually the entire analysis was programmed using the KNIME software.
