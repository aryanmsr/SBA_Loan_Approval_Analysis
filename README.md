# SBA_Loan_Approval_Analysis

Using a dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), containing historical data of small business loans approved from 1987 to 2014 with 27 variables and 899,164 observations, our aim is to address the following question through an algorithmic approach: "Based on the various risk factors entailed, should an SBA loan be approved or not?". The steps involved in this project include:

1. UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATASET
2. DATA PREPARATION, CLEANING AND EXPLORATION:
• Identification of variables that may be good predictors or risk indicators of the level of risk associated with a loan
• Data exploration : statistics and visualization
• Missing data management
• Outlier treatment
• Creation of new relevant variables
• Variable transformation
3. MODEL BUILDING AND EVALUATION
• Logistic Regression Implementation & Evaluation
• Artifical Neural Network Implementation & Evaluation
• Gradient Boosted Trees Implementation & Evaluation
4. MODEL COMPARISON:
• Comparison of the three models' performance based on relevant metrics to choose the best model
5. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS AND FURTHER INSIGHTS
